# Learning NodeJS

**Start:** 2025-02-01

Hi!<br>
I'm Francesco Di Muro, and this is my NodeJS learning journey.<br>
As the new year (2025) started, I want to learn this famous tool to enhance my knowledge in the Web Development field.<br>

I'm gonna structure this README as much in detail as I can, so it can be helpful to other learners as well.<br>
For sure, I'm gonna take some notes as well about the [guide](https://trainingportal.linuxfoundation.org/learn/course/introduction-to-nodejs-lfw111x/setting-up/setting-up-node?page=2) I'm studying.

So, let's get started!

### Lesson 1
fnm => **F**ast **N**ode **M**anager

To install the **L**ong-**T**erm **S**upport version of NodeJS, use the command
```cmd
fnm install --lts
```

To verify that Node has been installed correctly, run the command
```cmd
node --version
```
